## Volunteering
All [@py-pdf](https://github.com/py-pdf) members are volunteers.
They dedicate some of their time to maintain open-source projects, answer questions and review Pull Requests.

[@py-pdf](https://github.com/py-pdf) members should never be required to operate within deadlines, or even respond within a given time frame.

If you are a user of a [@py-pdf](https://github.com/py-pdf) project and want something done,
whether it is a bugfix or a feature request, your best options for achieving what you want are:

* being polite and patient
* volunteer to contribute yourself

To all [@py-pdf](https://github.com/py-pdf) members, remember: [it's okay to hit pause](https://opensource.guide/best-practices/#its-okay-to-hit-pause), and take time away from volunteer open-source work.


## Governance
**Redaction in progress...**

It's OK to [say no](https://opensource.guide/best-practices/#learning-to-say-no)

<!--
As recommended [by the opensource.guide](https://opensource.guide/leadership-and-governance/), a `GOVERNANCE.md` file in every repository could point to this page as reference.
-->

### GitHub roles
The base permission for [@py-pdf](https://github.com/py-pdf) members is set to **Write**,
meaning any [@py-pdf](https://github.com/py-pdf) member has read permissions,
can manage issues and pull requests, and also push to repositories.

**Redaction in progress...**

We encourage [@py-pdf](https://github.com/py-pdf) members, and especially maintainers, to make their organization membership **public**
on <https://github.com/orgs/py-pdf/people>, in order to clarify who has ownership of the organization, and the associated rights to perform package releases:
